# Why URL Tracker is good for you?

## **How it is going to increase your productivity by `atleast 2x` times**  <br/>
When you seach a `query` on chrome , generally you get 4-5 results on 1st page (Noone cares about next pages 😂). Let us assume that `No. 5` link eventually solves your problem. But most of the time you don't `click` directly on `No. 5` link, instead you check those links in `Top-Down order` untill you don't find desired result.  For simplicity , let us say, you spend `1 minute` on each web-page, it means it'll take approx. `5 minutes`  to get your answer. (`5th` link)

**Few moments later✈️** <br/>
After some times (hours, days, weeks etc), if you need to seach the `same query` , unless [Google  indexes](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7645831?hl=en)  those websites differently, you'll probably get your `desired answer` at `No. 5` link. But this time, you can't remember that link. So again you'll follow `Top-Down order` and spend approx. `5 minutes` to get `desired result`.
***
⚠️ Now you can see a `pattern of repeatition` here. You spend approx. `10 minutes` to get your `desired result` in `2 searches` (1st & 2nd time).  
🔎But if you look closely, the efforts made in 2nd time were redundant, which could have been `easily avoided`. 
***
🤔But how ? <br/>
😀 Very simple: If you know in advance, which link solved your problem last time. So you  click the same link this time, `avoiding other links`.

🏆🏆 **Consider this real world scenario on `long run 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️`** 🏆🏆 <br/>
[**Without tool**]: 😭If your `5th time` search & `1st time` search strategies are same, it can cost approx. `25 minutes` .  
[**With tool**]:  😎While if you use [this tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-tracker/aeledpmgdlojbmdllfejoefinemkhbbo), you will only spend approx. `5 minutes` over the course of `5 searches`. 
<br/>**Efficiency increased by 5x** times in this example.

## **How it is better than `bookmarking` the web-page** <br/>
No doubt, `bookmarking`  is great feature. But over the period your bookmark-list can grow very long. And I know , you don't like to go through all `bookmark-title` to get specific result. Instead you would probably prefer to search the query Instantaneously.
